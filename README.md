# Todo App with BLoC Architecture

This repository demonstrates how to implement a simple todo application using the BLoC (Business Logic Component) architecture. In addition to basic todo functionalities, this app also includes features such as tracking employee joining dates, deleting employees, and changing their designations. The BLoC pattern ensures a clean separation of UI and business logic, making the codebase more organized and maintainable.

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete tasks using a user-friendly interface.
- Keep track of employee joining dates and designate changes.
- Utilize the power of the BLoC architecture for efficient state management.
